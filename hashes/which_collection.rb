# car = {
#   type:  'sedan',
#   color: 'blue',
#   year:  2003
# }
#
# Rewrite car as a nested array containing the same key-value pairs.

car = [[:type, 'sedan'], [:color, 'blue'], [:year, 2003]]

# The data in this exercise is better suited for a hash because the
# values require labels. With an array, you're not able to label specific values.
